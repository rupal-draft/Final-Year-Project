# Identification of Essential Proteins of Cancer Using Deep Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on the identification of **essential proteins related to cancer** using deep learning techniques. The approach combines sequence-based features, entropy metrics, and protein-protein interaction network analysis to classify whether a given protein plays a crucial role in cancer development.

## Why These Features?

These features were chosen based on biological significance and computational relevance:

- **Sequence-based features** capture amino acid patterns
- **Shannon entropy** reflects sequence complexity
- **Centrality metrics** represent the protein‚Äôs role in interaction networks
- These factors are critical in determining protein essentiality in cancer pathways

## How Shannon Entropy Helps

Shannon entropy measures the randomness in a protein sequence. Proteins with high entropy may have diverse functional regions, suggesting essential biological roles. Residue-wise entropy helps to pinpoint variability at specific positions in the sequence.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pfeature
- Cytoscape + CytoNCA + StringApp
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

## Future Directions

- Expand dataset with more diverse cancer types
- Integrate 3D structural and expression data
- Add interpretability tools to explain model predictions
- Link predictions with clinical drug response data
