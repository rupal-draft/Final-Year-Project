# Cancer Research: Identifying Essential Proteins for Cancer Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to identify essential proteins related to cancer. The goal is to analyze datasets, apply feature selection methods, and build predictive models to enhance cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

## Objectives
- Identify key proteins associated with cancer.
- Develop machine learning models to predict cancer-related patterns.
- Apply statistical and feature selection techniques for data analysis.
- Interpret results to provide insights into potential cancer biomarkers.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- **Data Processing**: Clinical and demographic datasets
- **Machine Learning Techniques**: Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning, Feature selection
- **Feature Engineering**: Amino acid composition, Shannon entropy, physiochemical properties
- **Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

## Data Sources
- Publicly available datasets from **cancer research repositories**.
- Preprocessed and raw clinical data for model training and validation.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gather relevant clinical and protein datasets.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize, clean, and structure data for analysis.
3. **Feature Selection**: Apply techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), statistical correlation, and domain-specific features such as amino acid composition and Shannon entropy.
4. **Model Training**: Train ML models for classification and prediction.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for performance assessment.
6. **Interpretation & Insights**: Identify significant proteins and validate findings.

## Expected Outcomes
- A trained machine learning model capable of predicting cancer-related proteins.
- Insights into potential biomarkers that can aid in early detection and treatment planning.
- A research framework that can be extended to various types of cancer.
